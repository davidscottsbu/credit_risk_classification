## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project was to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company I built a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.  The lending data included loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status.  I fit a logistic regression model by using the training data, saved the predictions on the testing data labels, then evaluated the models performance.


## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
 
    * The accuracy scores for the Healthy Loans were 100% for the precision and 99% for the recall
    * The accuracy scores for the High Risk Loans were 85% for the precision and 91% for the recall

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* The Healthy loans perform better because the accuracy scores were nearly perfect 
* Although the model accurately predicts the scores of healthy loans it does not accurately predict the scores of high risk loans so I do not reccomend the model
